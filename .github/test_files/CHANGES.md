# isodatetime changes

THIS IS A TEST FILE

<!-- The topmost release date is automatically updated by GitHub Actions. When
creating a new release entry be sure to copy & paste the span tag with the
`actions:bind` attribute, which is used by a regex to find the text to be
updated. Only the first match gets replaced, so it's fine to leave the old
ones in. -->
